Provide high performance and minimise overheads of the OS
- Strive to provide virtualisation and other OS features without excessive overheads. 
- Overheads include:
	- Extra time (more instructions)
	- Extra space (in memory or in disk)

Provide protection between applications as well as between the OS and applications. 
- If we allow many programs to run at the same time, we want to make sure that the malicious or accidental bad behaviour of one does not harm others. 
- We certainty don't want an application to be able to harm the OS itself (that would affect all programs running on the system).
- Isolation: isolating process from one another is the key to protection and thus underlies much of what an OS must do.
- Reliability: The OS must run non-stop; when it fails all applications running on the system will fail as well. Therefore a high degree of reliability is needed.

Other goals
- Energy efficiency
- Security (extension of protection)
	- Against malicious applications in the highly networked world of modern times
	- Mobility as OSes are run on smaller and smaller devices.
