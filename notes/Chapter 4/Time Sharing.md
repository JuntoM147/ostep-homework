Time sharing is a basic technique used by an OS to share a resource. 

By allowing the resource to be used for a little while by one entity, and then a little while by another, and so forth, the resource in question can be used by many.

This time sharing mechanism is employed by all modern OSes.

The counter part to this is [[Space Sharing]]
