Resides on top of mechanisms

Policies are algorithms for making some kind of decision within the OS. 

The policy provides the answer to a ***which*** question. For example ***which*** process should the OS run right now?

E.g.
Given a number of possible programs to run on a CPU, which program should the OS run?

A scheduling policy in the OS will make this decision.
